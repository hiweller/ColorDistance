Title: Distance Metrics for Image Color Similarity
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: person("Hannah", "Weller", email = "hannahiweller@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Loads and displays images, selectively masks specified background
  colors, bins pixels by color using either data-dependent or automatically
  generated color bins, quantitatively measures color similarity among images
  using one of several distance metrics for comparing RGB or HSV clusters (primarily
  chi-squared or Wasserstein distances), and clusters images by object color 
  similarity. Originally written for use with organism coloration (reef fish color
  diversity, butterfly mimicry, etc), but easily applicable for any image set.
